                <p>The band originally formed as part of a TV show, in which over 400 people applied
                    to play the parts in a rock group called 'The Monkees'. The show which starred Davy Jones, 
                    Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences 
                    adored the humorous antics of the band. While the TV show ended in 1968 the band continued to 
                    have real life hits, but struggled against their "pre-fab four" image.</p>

                <p><b>Micky Dolenz</b> (George Michael Dolenz Jn.) was born in Los Angeles on March 8, 1945. 
                His dad, George, had starred in a number of films, and played the title character in the mid-1950s 
                television series The Count of Monte Cristo.</p>
                <p>Dolenz began his show-business career in 1956 when he starred in a children's show called Circus 
                Boy under the name Mickey Braddock. In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer 
                and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. </p>
                <p>Dolenz wrote a few of the band's self-penned songs, most prominent being "Randy Scouse Git" from the album 
                Headquarters. He provided the lead vocals for such hits as "Last Train to Clarksville", 
                "Take a Giant Step", and "I'm a Believer". Toward the end of the series' two-year run, 
                Dolenz directed and co-wrote the show's final episode.</p>

                <p><b>Michael Nesmith</b> (Robert Michael Nesmith) was born on Dec. 30, 1942 in Heuston, Texas. 
                He is an American musician, songwriter, actor, producer, novelist, businessman, and philanthropist, 
                best known as a member of the pop rock band the Monkees and co-star of the TV series The Monkees (1966â€“1968). 
                Nesmith's songwriting credits include "Different Drum" (sung by Linda Ronstadt with the Stone Poneys). </p>
                <p>Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a single on the Highness label. He followed this in 1965 
                with a one-off single released on Edan Records followed by two more recorded singles; one was titled "The New Recruit" 
                under the name "Michael Blessing", released on Colpix Records, coincidentally also the label of Davy Jones, 
                though they did not meet until the Monkees formed. </p>
                <p>Once he was cast in 'The Monkees', Screen Gems bought his songs so they could be used in the show. 
                Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for The Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere", "Mary, Mary" and 
                "Listen to the Band", became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the One", 
                is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure. </p>
                <p>Nesmith has been considered one of the pioneers of country rock. He also had moderate commercial success with 
                the First National Band. Their second single, "Joanne," hit No. 21 on the Billboard chart, No. 17 on Cashbox, 
                and No.4 in Canada, with the follow-up "Silver Moon" making No. 42 Billboard, No. 28 Cashbox, and No. 13 in Canada.</p>

                <p><b>Peter Tork</b> (Peter Halsten Thorkelson) was born on Feb. 13, 1942 in Washington, D.C.
                He began studying piano at the age of nine, showing an aptitude for music by learning to play several 
                different instruments, including the banjo and both acoustic bass and guitars.</p>
                <p>Tork auditioned and got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees in the mid-1960s. 
                He was the oldest member of the group, and a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play 
                their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he described as "third chair guitar" 
                on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, 
                banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, 
                the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake".</p>
                <p>In 1986, after a 1985 tour with Jones in Australia, Tork rejoined fellow Monkees Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz for a 
                highly successful 20th anniversary reunion tour. Three new songs were recorded by Tork and Dolenz for a greatest-hits 
                release. The three Monkees recorded Pool It!. A decade later, all four group members recorded Justus, the first 
                recording with all four members since 1968. The quartet performed live in the United Kingdom in 1997, but for the 
                next several years only the trio of Tork, Dolenz and Jones toured together.</p>
