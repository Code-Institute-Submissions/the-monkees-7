                <p>The band originally formed as part of a TV show, in which over 400 people applied
                    to play the parts in a rock group called 'The Monkees'. The show which starred Davy Jones, 
                    Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork premiered on September 12, 1966, and audiences 
                    adored the humorous antics of the band. While the TV show ended in 1968 the band continued to 
                    have real life hits, but struggled against their "pre-fab four" image.</p>
